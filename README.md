# to install and use npm package to a directory


1) initialize npm so that packages.json is created by ####   npm init
2) install that package #### npm install packageName@packageVersion -- to install locally
3) To install a npm package globally we need to use -g at last which stands for global

#### node install nodemon@1.18.5 -g

### nodemon is a good tool to use while development as it automatically updates the terminal output after change in code
